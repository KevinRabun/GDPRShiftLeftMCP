## Instructions
1. For each processing activity, identify:
   - Categories of data subjects
   - Categories of personal data (including any Art. 9 special categories)
   - Purposes of processing
   - Legal basis under Art. 6 (and Art. 9 for special categories)
   - Categories of recipients
   - International transfers and safeguards (Arts. 44–49)
   - Retention periods
   - Technical and organisational security measures (Art. 32)

2. Map data flows:
   - Data collection points (forms, APIs, third-party sources)
   - Internal data stores and processing systems
   - Data sharing with processors and third parties
   - Cross-border data transfers
   - Data outputs and reporting

3. Identify data-protection risks in the mapped flows:
   - Excessive data collection (minimisation principle)
   - Unclear legal basis
   - Missing processor agreements (Art. 28)
   - Unprotected international transfers
   - Inadequate security measures

4. Azure data-mapping resources:
   - Azure Purview for automated data discovery and classification
